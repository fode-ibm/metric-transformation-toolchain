template.description: "With this toolchain, you can develop, and deploy Message Transformation service into a Kubernetes cluster managed by the IBM Bluemix Container Service. By default it will use the Metric-Transformation repo, but you can link to your own GitHub repository instead. This toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery  Make sure that your container image registry is correctly set up with a [namespace](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/Registry/index.html). You can manage your Bluemix Container clusters in the [console](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/cs_cluster.html#cs_cluster).\n\nThis toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in your organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added at no cost to you. For more information and terms, see the [Bluemix catalog](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/).\n\nTo get started, click **Create**."
template.gettingStarted: " **Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change to the Git repo to trigger a new Docker image build, which will be scanned for vulnerabilites and deployed in your Kubernetes cluster. For step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/tutorials/tc_secure_kube?task=2) for this toolchain."
